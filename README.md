As demonstrated in the above video, the tracker can prove to be very valuable, and versatile. From simple tasks like viewing your created tables, to adding in new departments, roles or even employees. But it doesn't end there, you can also update an employees role, this can be made very useful if you made a mistake with employee input, want to promote or maybe even demote an employee (hopefully not that one ðŸ˜‚)

```
